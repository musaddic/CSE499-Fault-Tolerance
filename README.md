## A complete fault tolerance mechanism for scientific application using spot instance for cloud computing system.

Most business use server with fixed computing resources such as Memory, Hard Disk, Processor etc. However, many businesses are shifting towards cloud where resources can be attached to the server on demand based which can deduct costs associated with unused resources. Although this on-demand rapid access to computing resources doesnâ€™t require large upfront investments in hardware, most businesses who use this cloud computing services, do this process manually and inefficiently.

However, it is possible to build completely reliable, fault-tolerant and highly available system using modern cloud service providers like AWS. For example, AWS provides infrastructure building blocks which by themselves are fault-tolerant. But it is possible to achieve higher system availability and fault tolerance by using these infrastructures in such an arrangements and patterns so that any system failures such as massive DDOS attack, hard drives failures, power supplies failures, racks disruption etc. can be avoided very easily. In this research, I will propose a cloud infrastructure model which can use to achieve high availability and fault-tolerance for computing server and build the server model practically from scratch and test it with high traffic loads and stress script.
